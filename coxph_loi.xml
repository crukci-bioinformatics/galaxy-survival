.. class:: infomark

Fits a univariable Cox proportional hazards regression model on individual genes (probes) from the input list to see which genes (probes) are predictive of either recurrence or distant metastasis free survival (as selected). The gene expression values are taken from Loi et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 25:1239-1246, 2007 and are entered into the model as continuous variables. 

.. class:: infomark

This breast cancer dataset comprises gene expression profiles for primary tumours from 414 patients of which 277 were treated with Tamoxifen and 137 were untreated.

- Recurrence free survival data are available for 268 and 125 of the treated and untreated patients respectively.
- Distant metastasis free survival data are available for 250 and 125 of the treated and untreated patients respectively.

- 263 of the Tamoxifen treated group are ER-positive, 129 are PgR-positive and 124 are both ER- and PgR-positive.
- 86 of the untreated group are ER-positive, 56 are PgR-positive and 51 are both ER- and PgR-positive.

**Syntax**

This tool takes a list of gene symbols and matches each to an Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 probe ID (AffyID). A univariable Cox proportional hazards regression model is fitted for each probe and the output is the hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio (LB, UB) and p-value (PValue) for each probe.

- The input should be a single column list of gene symbols.
- A choice is offered as to whether to fit the model to predict the outcome of recurrence free survival time or the distant metastasis free survival time.
- There is also the option to choose the sub-population by selecting only ER-positive and/or PgR-positive tumours and whether the patients were treated with Tamoxifen or left untreated.
- The output is in tabular form and may contain multiple rows for each gene where there are multiple Affymetrix probes for that gene.
- Where the output gives NA for AffyID then there was no probe for that gene.
- Where the output gives NA for the HR/PValue, there was no gene expression for this probe within the dataset.
- The hazard ratio is the increase in the hazard of death for each unit increase in gene expression value.
- A hazard ratio of 1, means there is no increase in hazard of death for each unit increase in gene expression.
- A hazard ratio of &gt;1, means that the hazard of death increases with increasing gene expression value.
- A hazard ratio of &lt;1, means that the hazard of death decreases with increasing gene expression value.
- The confidence interval (LB=lower bound, UB=upper bound) gives the range of values of the HR that are consistent with the data.
- The p-value is the probability of seeing a hazard ratio at least as extreme as the one observed given the data.

**Example**

- Input gene list::

	PBK
	STK6

- Outcome::

	Recurrence free survival

- ER/PgR receptor status:: 

	ER-positive

- Treatment::

	Tamoxifen

- Output::

	GeneName	AffyID	HR	LB	UB	PValue
	PBK	219148_at	1.38	1.14	1.66	0.00083
	STK6	204092_s_at	1.5	1.19	1.9	0.00064
	STK6	208079_s_at	1.47	1.2	1.81	0.00027
	STK6	208080_at	1.8	0.80	4.03	0.15

In this example there is one probe for PBK found in the dataset and three probes found for STK6. The third probe for STK6 shows no evidence of an effect on survival (as p&gt;0.05). The other three probes all have a significant effect (as p&lt;0.05). The hazard ratio for PBK is 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 1.14, 1.66).  This means for each unit increase in PBK expression there is a 38% increase in risk of death/recurrence. The 95% confidence interval suggests that an increase in risk of between 14% and 66% per unit increase in PBK expression are also consistent with the data.
